    <h1 id="because">Crazy Ralph - The Real Story Behind the Real Story</h1>
    <p>
      My twin-grandchildren, Danny & Emma, then about 3 or 4 years old, always wanted to
      hear about Ralph's adventures whenever they slept over at our house. When asked if
      they would like a bedtime book-reading or a Boppa-told story (that would be me), their
      choice was always the same: "Tell us a Crazy Ralph story."
      The stories streamed from my memory, often filled in by my wife, and their grandmother, Julie.
      (She was the one that really raised Ralph.) I wasn't just telling his stories. I was reliving
      them.
      Ralph was a truly awesome dog. He had an untamed spirit that remained untamed
      despite our many efforts to train him over the years. He died in 2009, about a year
      before Danny & Emma were born in 2010.
      I decided to put his stories to print. Not in a published book, just written so they
      wouldn't be forgotten and so our youngest granddaughter, Aubrey (born in 2014), could
      learn about Crazy Ralph, too.
      The writing was just a collection of Ralph's outrageously-crazy adventures. Nothing
      more. There was no ending. Not much of a beginning either.
      Then came the time when "Luna," the grandkids' dog that they grew up with,
      started slowing down noticeably. She was about 9 or 10 years old then. It soon
      became obvious that Luna was close to the end of life's journey. She was dying. That's
      when I decided that Ralph's story had to have an ending. I wanted the twins, Danny
      and Emma, now 14-years-old, and Aubrey now 10 years old, to understand - and be
      comforted in knowing -- that the end of a dog's life here on earth is just the beginning of
      their never-ending life in paradise.
      I encouraged them to read the now completed book - with an ending narrated by Ralph
      himself - during this difficult time as Luna struggled. Emma informed me that they
      would be more inclined to read it, especially Aubrey, if the book was illustrated. So I
      hired a freelance illustrator to put together chapter illustrations. I then had most
      everything needed to publish. And so it was in 2025, the book was published on
      Amazon.
      The real purpose of "The Real-Life Story of Crazy Ralph" is to tell young readers that
      their deeply loved animal is now - not just in a better place - but in an indescribably
      magnificent place. And that theyve been restored to full health and vigor. Very importantly, they long to see their human family sometime in the distant future when
      everyone is together again in heaven.
      Most important is Ralph's last statement at the very end of the book. He implores his
      human family to "Please be happy for me … I hope you will bring another dog into your
      home and give him such a wonderful life as I had with you."
      If this book comforts children at all by understanding that their much-loved pet is in a
      wonderful paradise and wants their family to bring another dog into their wonderful
      home, then it has achieved its purpose.
      I'm 81 years old now and look forward to the day that I won't be simply reliving Crazy Ralph
      stories. I'll be living them. With Ralph.

    <p id="booksum">Ralph does everything his way. His own over-the-top-crazy way. Born the runt of his litter, this handsome little dog quickly learns to live life to the fullest. He believes he can fly like a bird, run up trees like a squirrel, gallop like a horse, and jump off cliffs like a mad man… in his mind, he can do anything. As a puppy, he makes life-long friends in an animal shelter, quickly becomes an amazingly accomplished escape artist, then heads out on a non-stop string of wild, jaw-dropping adventures. But Ralph's most important role in life is bodyguard for his little buddy, Squirt, who comes to live with him. Ralph's grandest adventure? It's genuinely out of this world. And proves how limitless a dog's love is. You'll see.  </p>

<h1> Thank Yous </h1>

<p> 
  As it turns out, the writing of The Real-Life Story of Crazy Ralph was the easy part
  I was house bound for a time due to medical issues and always wanted to document the Crazy Ralph bedtime stories I had told my twin grandkids. I had a younger
  granddaughter who would, I envisioned, want to hear the same stories. I enjoyed
  reliving them as I put the words to paper. It was easy. Especially because I didn't have to
  worry about punctuation and spelling and grammar and other such things.

<h1 id="manga">Julie "Manga" Harmon - The one that worried about punctuation, spelling, grammar and other such things.</h1>
<p>
  My wife, Julie, grandmother of our three grandchildren (who call her Manga), was the team member that read over the
  original manuscript (multiple times) and made a considerable number of
  substantive corrections, required strict adherence to annoying grammatical rules
  and proper spellings, and offered constructive criticisms a many. Irritating but
  apparently necessary for publishing. Most importantly, she is the one who
  accurately recalled many of the Crazy Ralph adventures. It is Manga that
  deserves more credit than anyone for bringing the Crazy Ralph story to print.
  Thank you!

<h1 id="dmitry">Dmitry Gitelman – For the wonderful, story-telling, hand-drawn illustrations. </h1>
<p>
  An amazing talent who stuck with us despite many changes and
  updates. We are forever in his debt for bringing Crazy Ralph's story to visual life.
  He grasped the essence of each chapter's adventure and created a truly
  compelling visual that said it all. The cover illustration is the pinnacle of his work.
  There are few illustrators in this day of digital everything that actually hand-draw
  their illustrations. Thank you!
</p>

<h1 id="paul">Paul Nylander, Illustrator – who pulled everything together and made the Crazy Ralph story into a real book. </h1>
<p>
  Paul formatted the book in a way that
  made it easy to read and compelling from one page to the next. No easy task.
  He selected the right typestyles and sizes, cropped and positioned the
  illustrations, re-designed the cover, and gave the book a genuinely professional
  look. Thank you!
